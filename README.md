# Flask Tutorial for Beginners
Welcome to the Flask documentation for beginners. While this isn't an official documentation, it's specifically tailored to newcomers who may find certain aspects of web development challenging. You can always return here as a valuable resource as you embark on your journey to learn Flask.

# What is Flask?
Flask is a fantastic starting point for developing web applications. It falls under the category of micro-frameworks, which means it doesn't come with everything included out of the box. However, this simplicity makes it extremely beginner-friendly, and you can still use it to create amazing web projects. Some well-known companies that utilize Flask in their projects include:

- Reddit
- Netflix
- CRED
- Lyft
- Trivago

# Do I Need to Learn External Languages?

**Not entirely**, however commerically (creating commerical projects) **you may need to learn some other languages and technologies alongside Flask.** While it's not absolutely necessary, **it's highly recommended**, especially for more complex or commercial projects. Here are some of the languages and technologies you might consider:

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the foundation of web development. It's used to create the structure and content of web pages. Flask typically focuses on the back-end of web development, so understanding HTML is crucial for designing the front-end of your web applications.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS complements HTML by providing styling and layout to your web pages. You'll use CSS to make your web applications visually appealing and user-friendly. It's essential for creating well-designed user interfaces.

3. JavaScript
JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language that enables interactive features on your website. While Flask can handle some basic interactivity, JavaScript is necessary for more advanced user interactions, like form validation, dynamic content updates, and complex animations.

By learning these additional languages and technologies in conjunction with Flask, you'll have a more comprehensive skill set to tackle a wide range of web development projects. While Flask simplifies server-side programming, these languages empower you to create engaging and dynamic web applications with well-structured front-end interfaces. So, don't hesitate to dive into the world of Flask and web development â€“ your journey to becoming a web developer is an exciting one!
